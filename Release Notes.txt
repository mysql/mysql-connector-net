Connector/NET 8.0  Release Notes
------------------------------------
Welcome to the release notes for Connector/NET 8.0

What's new in 8.0
--------------------
Connector/NET has implemented the new X DevAPI that enables communication 
using the X Protocol with a MySQL Server running the X Plugin, released 
with MySQL 5.7.x. With the X DevAPI you can write code that treats 
MySQL Server as a document database, using a NoSQL-like syntax that does 
not assume previous experience writing traditional SQL.
To learn more about how to write applications using X DevAPI see 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/index.html. 

This version also includes the support for .NET Core Framework, which enables
MySQL Connector/NET > = 7.0.4 to be run in all the platforms supported for this
framework. Entity Framework Core support is also included.

For General documentation about how to get started using MySQL as a document 
database, see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/document-database.html.
