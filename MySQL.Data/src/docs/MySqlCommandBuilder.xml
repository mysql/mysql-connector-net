    <summary>
      Automatically generates single-table commands used to reconcile changes made to a DataSet with the associated MySQL database. This class cannot be inherited.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        The <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter"/> does not automatically generate the SQL statements required to
        reconcile changes made to a <see cref="System.Data.DataSet">DataSet</see> with the associated instance of MySQL.
        However, you can create a <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B> object to automatically generate SQL statements for
        single-table updates if you set the <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter.SelectCommand">SelectCommand</see> property
        of the <B>MySqlDataAdapter</B>. Then, any additional SQL statements that you do not set are generated by the
        <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B> registers itself as a listener for <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter.OnRowUpdating">RowUpdating</see>
        events whenever you set the <see cref="DataAdapter"/> property. You can only associate one
        <B>MySqlDataAdapter</B> or <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B> object with each other at one time.
      </para>

      <para>
        To generate INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements, the <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B> uses the
        <B>SelectCommand</B> property to retrieve a required set of metadata automatically. If you change
        the <B>SelectCommand</B> after the metadata has is retrieved (for example, after the first update), you
        should call the <see cref="RefreshSchema"/> method to update the metadata.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <B>SelectCommand</B> must also return at least one primary key or unique
        column. If none are present, an <I>InvalidOperation</I> exception is generated,
        and the commands are not generated.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B> also uses the <see cref="MySqlCommand.Connection">Connection</see>,
        <see cref="MySqlCommand.CommandTimeout">CommandTimeout</see>, and <see cref="MySqlCommand.Transaction">Transaction</see>
        properties referenced by the <B>SelectCommand</B>. The user should call
        <B>RefreshSchema</B> if any of these properties are modified, or if the
        <B>SelectCommand</B> itself is replaced. Otherwise the <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter.InsertCommand">InsertCommand</see>,
        <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter.UpdateCommand">UpdateCommand</see>, and
        <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter.DeleteCommand">DeleteCommand</see> properties retain
        their previous values.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you call <i>Dispose</i>, the <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B> is disassociated
        from the <B>MySqlDataAdapter</B>, and the generated commands are no longer used.
      </para>

      <note>
        Caution must be used when using MySqlCOmmandBuilder on MySql 4.0 systems.  With MySql 4.0,
        database/schema information is not provided to the connector for a query.  This means that
        a query that pulls columns from two identically named tables in two or more different databases
        will not cause an exception to be thrown but will not work correctly.  Even more dangerous
        is the situation where your select statement references database X but is executed in
        database Y and both databases have tables with similar layouts.  This situation can cause
        unwanted changes or deletes.
        This note does not apply to MySQL versions 4.1 and later.

    <example>
      The	following example uses the <see cref="MySqlCommand"/>, along
      <see cref="MySqlDataAdapter"/> and <see cref="MySqlConnection"/>, to
      select rows from a data source. The example is passed an initialized
      <see cref="System.Data.DataSet"/>, a connection string, a
      query string that is a SQL SELECT statement, and a string that is the
      name of the database table. The example then creates a <B>MySqlCommandBuilder</B>.
